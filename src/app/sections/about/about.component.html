  <h2>A bit about me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a dedicated front-end developer specializing in Angular, but I’m always
    eager to explore new front-end technologies and trends. My goal is to build
    intuitive, responsive, and visually engaging websites that not only look
    great but also provide a smooth user experience. With a keen eye for design
    and a deep understanding of modern front-end frameworks, I focus on writing
    clean, efficient code while prioritizing accessibility and performance.
    Whether you're looking for a dynamic single-page app or a fully responsive
    site, I’m excited to bring your ideas to life.
