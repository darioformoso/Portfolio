  a Front-End Developer Passionate About Creating Seamless Web Experiences

<p>
  Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a dedicated front-end developer specializing in
  Angular, but I’m always eager to explore new front-end technologies and
  trends. My goal is to build intuitive, responsive, and visually engaging
  websites that not only look great but also provide a smooth user experience.
  With a keen eye for design and a deep understanding of modern front-end
  frameworks, I focus on writing clean, efficient code while prioritizing
  accessibility and performance. Whether you're looking for a dynamic
  single-page app or a fully responsive site, I’m excited to bring your ideas to
  life.
